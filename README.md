# GettingAndCleaningData
This repository cotains the following files:

    run_analysis.R
    Codebook.md
    tidy_data.txt
   

The "run_analysis.R" file contains the R code that can be used to achieve the following:

    Transform the UCIHAR Dataset into a matrix of (observations) x (variables), where each observation is one of the 10299 data points captured in the appropriate study[1], and each of the rows is one of the variables measured.
    Produce a new dataset, which contains only the average value of each of the variables for each subject. For details see the description of the appropriate file in the Codebook.md file.

The Codebook.md file describes the ouput files of run_analysis.R.

The data used to generate the files in this repository was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. For detailed information about the data see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
